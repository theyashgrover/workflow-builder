# Project Brief :
The project is a workflow management tool built using React-Flow and Redux in React. It allows users to create, visualize, and manipulate very basic data processing workflows through a user-friendly interface. 
Workflows consist of various nodes representing data input, transformation, and output operations. Users can upload CSV files as input data(for now), add nodes for filtering, mapping, finding, and reducing data, and visualize the workflow graphically. The tool also provides functionality for running the workflow and downloading the results. Built-in features include drag-and-drop node placement, real-time data visualization, and exporting as image/csv/json for saving workflows.
Please Note : This is built as a part of an assignment for the role of React Developer.
